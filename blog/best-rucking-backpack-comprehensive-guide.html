                    </div>
                    <div class="budget-option">
                        <h4>$150-250: Sweet Spot</h4>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>3. Key Features to Consider</h3>

                    <li>Cheap tactical knockoffs with poor stitching</li>
                    <li>Packs without proper weight distribution systems</li>

            <h2>Final Thoughts: Choose Based on Your Commitment Level</h2>
            <p>The best rucking backpack is the one you'll actually use consistently. If you're just starting out, an ALICE pack or 5.11 Rush series will serve you well without breaking the bank. Once you're committed to regular rucking, invest in a Frontline Athletic or GoRuck pack for the comfort and durability that will support years of training.</p>

            <blockquote class="closing-quote">
                "GoRuck makes insanely durable backpacks that can hold weight and virtually anything else without showing damage, which explains why they dominate the recommendations despite their higher price point."
                <cite>- Collective user sentiment from forums</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Remember: your pack is an investment in your fitness journey. Choose quality that matches your commitment level, and don't forget that proper weight progression and training consistency matter more than having the most expensive gear.</p>
