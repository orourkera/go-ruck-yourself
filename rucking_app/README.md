# GRY - Go Ruck Yourself

A mobile application for tracking rucking workouts, built with Flutter.

## Overview

GRY (Go Ruck Yourself) helps users track their rucking sessions, including distance, pace, calories burned, and elevation changes. Users can create, start, pause, and complete rucking sessions, as well as view their historical data and statistics.

## Features

- User authentication (registration, login, profile management)
- Create and manage rucking sessions
- Real-time GPS tracking during sessions
- Session statistics (distance, elevation, calories burned, etc.)
- Historical data visualization (weekly, monthly, yearly summaries)
- Integration with health apps (Apple Health, Google Fit)
- Offline support
- Dark and light theme

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components, screens, and BLoC for state management
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, use cases, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, data sources, and models
