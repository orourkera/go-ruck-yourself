### 4.3. Supabase Storage Integration

#### 4.3.1. Storage Configuration
- Create a dedicated storage bucket in Supabase for ruck photos:
  ```sql
  -- Create a bucket for ruck photos with public read access
  INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
  VALUES ('ruck-photos', 'Ruck Photos', true);
  ```

- Set up storage structure:
  ```
  storage/
    ├── ruck-photos/
    │   ├── [user_id]/
    │   │   ├── [ruck_id]/
    │   │   │   ├── original/
    │   │   │   │   ├── [photo_id].jpg
    │   │   │   ├── thumbnails/
    │   │   │   │   ├── [photo_id].jpg
  ```

#### 4.3.2. Security Policies
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
  ```sql
  -- Allow all authenticated users to view any ruck photo
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view any ruck photo"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'ruck-photos');
  
  -- Allow users to upload their own photos only
  CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own photos"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'ruck-photos' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
  
  -- Allow users to delete only their own photos
  CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own photos"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id = 'ruck-photos' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
  ```

#### 4.3.3. Photo Upload Process
1. Generate a unique photo ID (UUID)
2. Create the proper storage path: `user_id/ruck_id/original/photo_id.extension`
3. Upload the file to Supabase storage
4. Generate a thumbnail using Supabase's transformation parameters
5. Store the photo metadata in the database
6. Return the complete RuckPhoto object with public URLs

#### 4.3.4. URL Construction
- Construct public URLs for images using Supabase's pattern:
  ```dart
  final publicUrl = '${supabaseUrl}/storage/v1/object/public/$bucketName/$path';
  ```
- For thumbnails, add transformation parameters:
  ```dart
  final thumbnailUrl = '$publicUrl?width=200&height=200&resize=contain';
  ```

### 4.4. Real-time Updates (Optional Enhancement)
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time notifications:
  - `socket.io` or similar technology
  - Emit events when new likes or comments are received
  - Update notification count in real-time

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1. Photo Upload Security
- Implement file type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- Set reasonable file size limits (5MB per photo recommended)
- Generate random filenames to prevent path traversal attacks
- Scan uploaded content for malware (if feasible)

### 5.2. Privacy Controls
- Ensure photos are only accessible to authorized users
- Add user setting to control whether their photos are visible to others
- Include appropriate terms of service for user-generated content

### 5.3. Content Moderation
- Define a process for users to report inappropriate content
- Consider implementing automated content moderation for photos
- Create admin tools to review and remove reported content

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1. Optimizing Photo Loading
- Use thumbnails in list views to reduce bandwidth
- Implement lazy loading for photos in carousels
- Cache photos locally after first load

### 6.2. Efficient Notifications
- Batch notification processing on the server
- Use pagination for notification lists
- Consider polling versus push mechanisms based on user activity

## 8. Implementation Phases
