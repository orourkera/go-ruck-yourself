# Paywall Restoration Guide

## Overview
This document provides complete instructions for re-enabling the paywall system that was temporarily disabled to make the app 100% free. All paywall code has been preserved in comments and can be restored by following these steps.

## Current State (Paywall Disabled)
- **Ruck Buddies**: Fully accessible without subscription
- **Stats**: Fully accessible without subscription  
- **Notifications**: No premium upsells shown
- **First Launch**: No paywall shown to new users
- **Premium Status**: Not checked or initialized

## Files Modified

### 1. PremiumTabInterceptor
**File**: `/lib/features/premium/presentation/widgets/premium_tab_interceptor.dart`

**Current State**: Always returns `widget.child` (allows access to all tabs)

**To Restore**:
1. **Remove the early return**: Delete these lines (around line 31):
   ```dart
   // PAYWALL DISABLED: Always allow access to all features
   // Making app 100% free temporarily
   return widget.child;
   ```

2. **Uncomment the BlocBuilder logic**: Remove the `/*` and `*/` around the original paywall logic (lines ~35-75)

3. **Uncomment the premium status check in initState**: Remove the comment markers around:
   ```dart
   if (widget.tabIndex == 2 || widget.tabIndex == 3) {
     WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
       context.read<PremiumBloc>().add(CheckPremiumStatus());
     });
   }
   ```

4. **Uncomment the _getFeatureDescription method**: Remove the `/*` and `*/` around the method at the end of the file

### 2. HomeScreen 
**File**: `/lib/features/ruck_session/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Current State**: Premium status initialization disabled

**To Restore**:
1. **Uncomment premium status initialization** in `initState()` (around line 117):
   ```dart
   context.read<PremiumBloc>().add(InitializePremiumStatus());
   ```

2. **Uncomment app lifecycle premium refresh** in `didChangeAppLifecycleState()` (around line 135):
   ```dart
   if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
     context.read<PremiumBloc>().add(CheckPremiumStatus());
   }
   ```

### 3. NotificationInterceptor
**File**: `/lib/features/premium/presentation/widgets/notification_interceptor.dart`

**Current State**: Always executes premium navigation without checks

**To Restore**:
1. **Remove the early return logic**: Delete these lines (around line 25):
   ```dart
   // PAYWALL DISABLED: Always allow access and execute premium navigation
   if (onPremiumNavigation != null) {
     WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
       onPremiumNavigation!();
     });
   }
   return fallbackWidget ?? const SizedBox.shrink();
   ```

2. **Uncomment the BlocBuilder logic**: Remove the `/*` and `*/` around the original paywall logic

3. **Uncomment all preserved methods**: Remove the `/*` and `*/` around:
   - `_buildEngagementTeaser()`
   - `_buildBlurredStat()`
   - `_getNotificationTitle()`
   - `_getNotificationPreview()`

### 4. SplashScreen
**File**: `/lib/features/splash/presentation/screens/splash_screen.dart`

**Current State**: Skips paywall for first-time users

**To Restore**:
1. **Remove the paywall bypass logic**: Delete these lines (around line 135):
   ```dart
   // PAYWALL DISABLED: Skip paywall and go straight to home
   debugPrint('[Splash] First launch - PAYWALL DISABLED, navigating to HomeScreen.');
   await FirstLaunchService.markPaywallSeen();
   Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/home');
   ```

2. **Uncomment the original paywall logic**: Remove the `/*` and `*/` around:
   ```dart
   // First time user sees paywall - show it and mark as seen
   debugPrint('[Splash] First launch - showing PaywallScreen.');
   await FirstLaunchService.markPaywallSeen();
   Navigator.pushReplacement(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const PaywallScreen()),
   );
   ```

## Code Search Tips

To quickly find all disabled paywall code:

```bash
# Find all "PAYWALL DISABLED" comments
grep -r "PAYWALL DISABLED" lib/

# Find all "PRESERVED FOR FUTURE RESTORATION" comments  
grep -r "PRESERVED FOR FUTURE RESTORATION" lib/

# Find all "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" comments
grep -r "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" lib/
```

## Premium Features That Will Be Gated Again

Once restored, these features will require premium subscription:

1. **Ruck Buddies** (Tab Index 2)
   - Social features
   - Community interaction
   - Session sharing

2. **Stats** (Tab Index 3)

## Validation After Restoration

1. **Free Users**: Should see paywalls when accessing premium features
2. **Premium Users**: Should have full access to all features
3. **New Users**: Should see paywall on first launch
4. **Notification Taps**: Should show premium upsell for free users
5. **Subscription Flow**: Should work end-to-end
6. **Status Refresh**: Should update when app resumes from background
