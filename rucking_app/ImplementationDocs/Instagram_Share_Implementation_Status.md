## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Instagram-first approach** - Other platforms moved to V2
2. **Client-side AI processing** - Using existing OpenAI services
3. **Smart prompting** - Frequency based on user engagement
4. **Privacy by default** - Opt-in route blurring
5. **Template system** - 3 distinct styles for different moods

### Technical Highlights:
- Leverages existing infrastructure (OpenAI, user-insights)
- Minimal backend changes required
- Progressive engagement model
- Real-time streaming previews
- Persistent user preferences

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES
