# Claude Code Instructions for Rucking App

## DO NOT RUN BUILDS
**NEVER run `flutter run` or any build commands.** The user will handle running and testing the application.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Testing Commands
If code changes need testing, ask the user to run the build rather than attempting to run it yourself.

### Common Commands
- For linting: `flutter analyze`
- For formatting: `dart format .`
- For getting dependencies: `flutter pub get`
