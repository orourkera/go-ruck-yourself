    <h2>6. AI Cheerleader Feature</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Third-Party AI Services:</strong> The AI Cheerleader feature relies on third-party artificial intelligence services (OpenAI and ElevenLabs) to generate and synthesize motivational content. By enabling this feature, you acknowledge that your session data will be processed by these external services.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> All motivational messages and audio content generated by the AI Cheerleader are created by artificial intelligence and do not represent the views, opinions, or advice of Get Rucky, Inc. We do not guarantee the accuracy, appropriateness, or quality of AI-generated content.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> The AI Cheerleader feature depends on third-party services and internet connectivity. We cannot guarantee continuous availability and may temporarily disable the feature for maintenance or if third-party services become unavailable.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Disclaimers:</strong> AI-generated motivational content may include personality-based variations that could contain strong language or adult themes if you enable explicit content options. You are responsible for choosing appropriate personality settings for your environment.</li>
      <li><strong>No Medical Advice:</strong> AI Cheerleader content is for motivational purposes only and does not constitute medical, fitness, or professional advice. Do not rely on AI-generated content for health or safety decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Encouragement/Coaching-Like Features:</strong> Any features that provide prompts, encouragement, insights, or perceived coaching (including AI Cheerleader) are not medical, clinical, or professional advice and should not be used for diagnosis, treatment, or safety decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Session context sent to AI services is processed according to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for how third-party AI providers handle your data beyond our control.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>The app and blog are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. Use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages or injuries resulting from your use of the app or blog, including those arising from any encouragement, insights, prompts, or perceived coaching features (e.g., AI Cheerleader).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time, for any reason.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be posted in the app or on our website. Continued use of the app means you accept the new terms.</p>
