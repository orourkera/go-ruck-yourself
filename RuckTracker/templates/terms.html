    <h2>6. AI Cheerleader Feature</h2>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Content Disclaimers:</strong> AI-generated motivational content may include personality-based variations that could contain strong language or adult themes if you enable explicit content options. You are responsible for choosing appropriate personality settings for your environment.</li>
      <li><strong>No Medical Advice:</strong> AI Cheerleader content is for motivational purposes only and does not constitute medical, fitness, or professional advice. Do not rely on AI-generated content for health or safety decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Session context sent to AI services is processed according to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for how third-party AI providers handle your data beyond our control.</li>
