<h2>How Much Weight Should You Use in a Weighted Vest (or Ruck)?</h2>
<p>Go lighter than your ego. Start at ~5–10% of body weight. Walk easy, keep great form, and progress one knob at a time. The goal is repeatable sessions—not heroics followed by ice and regret.</p>

<h3>Why 5–10% BW works</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Metabolic bump without meltdown</strong>: Small vest loads measurably raise VO2 and energy cost compared with unloaded walking.</li>
  <li><strong>Injury risk management</strong>: Load carriage increases ground reaction forces and fatigue—bigger jumps raise risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Terrain amplifies stress</strong>: Uphill, uneven, or trail surfaces stack effort on top of load.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progression playbook</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1–2: 20–30 minutes, 5–10% BW, flat terrain.</li>
  <li>Weeks 3–4: add 10 minutes total OR +2–4% BW OR slight hills—not all three.</li>
  <li>Steady state breathing; keep steps short; straps snug.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to increase</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RPE ≤ 6/10, no joint pain, next-day legs feel “used” not “wrecked.”</li>
  <li>2–3 sessions/week for 2 weeks at current load with no red flags.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Red flags (don’t progress yet)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Joint pain during or after (knees, hips, back). Deload and fix fit first. See <a href="/blog/rucking-and-knee-back-safety">Knee/Back Safety</a>.</li>
  <li>Persistent hotspots or blisters. Address socks/shoes and strap tension before adding weight.</li>
  <li>Form breaks down: long strides, hips hinging, or pack bounce. Clean it up, then progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progression scenarios</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time-rich, stress-light</strong>: keep weight the same, add 5–10 minutes per week until 45–60 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Busy schedule</strong>: hold time at 30–40 minutes, add 2–4% BW every 1–2 weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Hilly routes</strong>: add time or gentle grade—not both with weight. See <a href="/blog/hills-incline-effects-rucking-weighted-vest">Incline Effects</a>.</li>
