<h2>Weighted Vest and Ruck Fitting: Stop the Bounce, Save the Joints</h2>
<p>Fit is free speed. Snug gear reduces wasted motion and hot spots—and keeps the session enjoyable enough to repeat.</p>

<h3>Checklist</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vest</strong>: secure closures that don’t creep, even plate placement front/back, no rib pinch on a deep breath, minimal bounce when marching in place.</li>
  <li><strong>Ruck</strong>: load high and close to your spine, shoulder straps snug, plate/bricks immobilized with sleeve/foam so there’s no clunk.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoes</strong>: stable platform; replace squishy, compressed midsoles that roll under load; pair with merino/technical socks.</li>
  <li><strong>Posture</strong>: short steps, slight forward lean from the ankles (not at the hips), relaxed hands, proud chest.</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing</strong>: easy nasal or conversational breathing most of the time; tighten fit if you feel the load shifting as you inhale.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Quick fit drills (2 minutes at home)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bounce test</strong>: 30 marching steps in place. The load should move with you, not against you.</li>
  <li><strong>Breath test</strong>: 10 slow inhales. If you feel rib pinch or plate shift, adjust closures or re-seat the load.</li>
  <li><strong>Hop test</strong>: three gentle hops. Any clunking = add towel/foam or tighten straps until silent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vest: step‑by‑step fit</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place plates evenly front/back. Start lighter than you think; add weight only when fit is dialed.</li>
  <li>Fasten lower closures first (controls bounce), then upper closures (controls chest/shoulder feel).</li>
  <li>Re-test marching and breathing. Fine‑tune to eliminate slide without choking off expansion.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ruck: step‑by‑step fit</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Seat the weight high, near the shoulder blades. Fill voids with a towel to lock it in.</li>
  <li>Cinch shoulder straps until the pack stays glued during a light hop. Add/remap sternum strap if needed.</li>
  <li>Optional hip belt for longer/heavier days—should carry some load without pulling the pack low.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common problems → quick fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rib pinch or chest pressure</strong>: loosen top closures slightly; shift more tension to the lower straps; confirm plate edges aren’t contacting ribs.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoulder hot spots</strong>: add/adjust padding; raise load higher; shorten stride; consider a sternum strap to spread pressure.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower back ache</strong>: weight is too low/far; re-pack higher and closer; check you’re leaning from ankles, not hinging at hips.</li>
  <li><strong>Foot blisters</strong>: swap to wool/synthetic socks; test different lacing; apply a dab of lube to hot spots before you head out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why this matters (data)</h3>
<p>Load carriage increases impact and fatigue; sloppy mechanics magnify it. Terrain and grade raise energy cost—don’t donate extra via bounce. A secure, high, close load improves economy and keeps technique crisp as you tire, so more of your effort becomes productive forward motion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Even small loads increase VO2 and vertical ground reaction forces; fit and posture modulate how that load is tolerated.</li>
  <li>Uneven surfaces and hills multiply effort; tight, non‑oscillating gear reduces wasted work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next steps: dial fit, then add load or time gradually.
