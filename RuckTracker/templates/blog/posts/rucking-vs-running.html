<h2>Rucking vs Running: Overview</h2>
<p>Both rucking and running are excellent for cardiovascular fitness—each shines in different situations. If you want lower joint impact with meaningful calorie burn and strength benefits, rucking wins. If you want speed, maximal VO2 stimulus, and time-trial goals, running wins.</p>

<h2>Calories and Weight Loss</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Running:</strong> Higher burn per minute at faster paces.</li>
  <li><strong>Rucking:</strong> Comparable burn at moderate loads and hills, often more sustainable for longer durations.</li>
  <li><strong>Adherence:</strong> The best modality is the one you’ll stick with—rucking’s lower impact helps consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Joint Impact and Injury Risk</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Running:</strong> High repetitive impact; common issues include shin splints and knee pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Rucking:</strong> Lower impact than running; be mindful of load progression and posture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strength and Endurance Adaptations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Running:</strong> Aerobic engine, stride economy, and speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Rucking:</strong> Aerobic base plus loaded carry strength (core, glutes, traps, spinal erectors).</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Choose Which</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose running</strong> for race goals, time trials, or speed development.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose rucking</strong> for joint-friendly fat loss, hiking prep, tactical readiness, or general fitness.</li>
  <li><strong>Combine both</strong> for hybrid endurance and strength.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Weekly Blend</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2x easy rucks (30–60 min)</li>
  <li>1x hill ruck or intervals with light load</li>
  <li>1–2x runs (easy + optional tempo)</li>
  <li>2x short strength sessions (hinge, squat, push, pull)</li>
</ul>
