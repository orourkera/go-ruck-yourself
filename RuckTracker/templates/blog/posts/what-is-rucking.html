<h2>What is Rucking?</h2>
<p>Rucking is simply walking with weight. Think of it as "dad cardio" with a backpack—born in the military, perfect for busy adults. It's low-impact, sneaky-effective, and builds endurance and strength without the knee-bashing of running. I sometimes start a bit too hot (classic), then tighten the straps, fix my pace, and let the data do its thing.</p>

<p><strong>The Science:</strong> Research from the U.S. Army Research Institute shows that loaded walking (rucking) can improve cardiovascular fitness by 15-20% while reducing impact forces on joints by up to 50% compared to running at equivalent intensities. A 2019 study in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> found that 12 weeks of weighted walking increased VO2 max by an average of 12% in sedentary adults.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Rucking</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low-impact calorie burn:</strong> Studies show rucking burns 30-45% more calories than regular walking. A 180lb person burns ~400-500 calories/hour rucking with 20-30lbs vs ~280 calories walking.</li>
  <li><strong>Builds strength and posture:</strong> EMG studies demonstrate 40% greater posterior chain activation vs walking. Core stability improves by 25% after 8 weeks of regular rucking.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-efficient:</strong> Research indicates adding just 10% bodyweight can increase training stimulus by 35-50% without extending workout duration.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental health benefits:</strong> A 2020 study found outdoor weighted walking reduced cortisol levels by 23% and improved mood scores by 18% vs indoor exercise.</li>
  <li><strong>Bone density:</strong> Weight-bearing exercise like rucking increases bone mineral density 2-3x more effectively than non-weighted cardio.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Start Rucking</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose a pack:</strong> Any sturdy backpack works to start. Dedicated ruck packs are more comfortable for heavier loads.</li>
  <li><strong>Start light:</strong> 5–10% of bodyweight for beginners. Focus on form before adding weight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick safe terrain:</strong> Flat paths first, then add hills or trails as you adapt.</li>
  <li><strong>Walk tall:</strong> Neutral spine, shoulders back, core engaged. Shorter, quick steps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Load placement:</strong> Research shows carrying weight high and close (within 2 inches of back) reduces energy expenditure by 8-12% vs loose packs.</li>
  <li><strong>Strap tension:</strong> Proper strap adjustment reduces vertical oscillation by up to 15%, decreasing fatigue and injury risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Hip belt usage:</strong> Transfers 60-70% of load from shoulders to hips, reducing upper body fatigue on distances >3 miles.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive overload:</strong> Military research recommends increasing only one variable per week: 10% distance OR 5-10% weight OR 5% pace to minimize injury risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Cadence:</strong> Optimal step rate is 160-180 steps/minute for efficiency, based on biomechanical analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gear Basics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backpack:</strong> Padded straps and frame sheet help a lot.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Ruck plates, dumbbells, sandbags, or water jugs.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Supportive walking/hiking shoes. Trail shoes for off-road.</li>
  <li><strong>Socks:</strong> Wool or synthetic to minimize blisters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beginner Plan (2–3x/week)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Week 1–2: 30–40 min, light weight, easy pace</li>
  <li>Week 3–4: 40–50 min, same weight, varied terrain</li>
  <li>Week 5–6: Keep time, add a small weight increase</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety and Recovery</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pain vs fatigue:</strong> Studies show 85% of rucking injuries are overuse-related. Sharp pain indicates tissue damage; stop immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobility work:</strong> Research demonstrates 15-20% injury reduction with post-ruck stretching focusing on calves, hip flexors, and IT band.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength training:</strong> Glute and core strengthening reduces lower back pain by 40% in regular ruckers (2018 military study).</li>
  <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Rucking increases fluid needs by 150-200% vs walking. Aim for 16-24oz/hour in moderate conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery metrics:</strong> Heart rate variability drops 10-15% after heavy ruck sessions; allow 24-48 hours between intense sessions.</li>
</ul>
