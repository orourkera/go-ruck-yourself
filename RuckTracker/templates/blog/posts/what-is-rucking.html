<h2>What is Rucking?</h2>
<p>Rucking is simply walking with weight. Traditionally, this comes from military training where soldiers carry a loaded rucksack for distance. Today, rucking is a highly effective, low-impact fitness activity that improves endurance, strength, and cardiovascular health—without the pounding of running.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Rucking</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low-impact calorie burn:</strong> Burn more than walking, often comparable to easy running depending on load and pace.</li>
  <li><strong>Builds strength and posture:</strong> Engages posterior chain, core, and stabilizers.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-efficient:</strong> Add weight to turn a normal walk into a powerful workout.</li>
  <li><strong>Great outdoors:</strong> Explore trails, parks, and neighborhoods while training.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Start Rucking</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose a pack:</strong> Any sturdy backpack works to start. Dedicated ruck packs are more comfortable for heavier loads.</li>
  <li><strong>Start light:</strong> 5–10% of bodyweight for beginners. Focus on form before adding weight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick safe terrain:</strong> Flat paths first, then add hills or trails as you adapt.</li>
  <li><strong>Walk tall:</strong> Neutral spine, shoulders back, core engaged. Shorter, quick steps.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Distribute load high and close to your back.</li>
  <li>Tighten shoulder straps to reduce bounce.</li>
  <li>Use a hip belt for longer distances to share load.</li>
  <li>Progress slowly: increase only one variable at a time (distance, weight, or pace).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gear Basics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backpack:</strong> Padded straps and frame sheet help a lot.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Ruck plates, dumbbells, sandbags, or water jugs.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoes:</strong> Supportive walking/hiking shoes. Trail shoes for off-road.</li>
  <li><strong>Socks:</strong> Wool or synthetic to minimize blisters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beginner Plan (2–3x/week)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Week 1–2: 30–40 min, light weight, easy pace</li>
  <li>Week 3–4: 40–50 min, same weight, varied terrain</li>
  <li>Week 5–6: Keep time, add a small weight increase</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety and Recovery</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stop if you feel sharp pain. Fatigue is normal; pain is not.</li>
  <li>Stretch calves/hip flexors. Strengthen glutes/core to support better form.</li>
  <li>Hydrate and fuel—rucking is deceptively demanding.</li>
</ul>
