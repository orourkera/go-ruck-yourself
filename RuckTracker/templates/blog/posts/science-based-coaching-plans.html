<!-- Hook -->
<p><strong>Personalized plans win</strong>â€”especially under load. Our new <strong>Coaching Plans</strong> translate exercise science and loadâ€‘carriage research into weekâ€‘byâ€‘week progressions you can trust. Every plan is built on conservative, testâ€‘retest templates with <em>oneâ€‘knobâ€‘atâ€‘aâ€‘time</em> progressions to protect joints and build durable fitness.</p>

<!-- Introduction -->
<p>Whether you want to <strong>age strong</strong>, <strong>get faster</strong>, <strong>lose fat</strong>, <strong>build load capacity</strong>, or <strong>prep for an event</strong>, each plan balances <em>time under load, aerobic intensity (Zone 2 and tempo), and strength</em>â€”and adapts to your schedule, terrain, and risk profile. Personalization knobs (equipment, time budget, intensity control, safe starting load, weather/route swaps) ensure the program fits <em>you</em>, not the other way around.</p>

<h2>Coaching Plans at a glance</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> a personalized, guardâ€‘railed training system that turns your preferences and history into an adaptive weekâ€‘byâ€‘week planâ€”seeded on your calendar from day one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personalized from the start:</strong> We use your answers (time budget, risk profile, terrain, schedule, equipment) and <em>available training history</em> to set safe starting loads and weekly structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Your style, your tone:</strong> Plans respect your coaching personality preference for guidance and notificationsâ€”firm drill sergeant or supportive friend, we coach how you like it.</li>
  <li><strong>Autoâ€‘generated sessions:</strong> When you start a plan, your sessions are seeded to your start date so you can train immediatelyâ€”no blank calendar.</li>
  <li><strong>Builtâ€‘in guardrails:</strong> Oneâ€‘knobâ€‘perâ€‘week (time <em>or</em> vert <em>or</em> load), weekly increase cap (~10%), deload weeks, and fixedâ€‘load quality days to prevent compounding stress.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective checks:</strong> HR decoupling guidance (â‰¤10% on Z2), scheduled retests (e.g., 60â€‘min ruck, functional balance/strength) to track real progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Fueling & hydration:</strong> Practical ACSMâ€‘aligned recommendations (carbs/hr, sodium/L) embedded for long days and heat.</li>
  <li><strong>Eventâ€‘ready:</strong> Event Prep includes load alignment, milestone simulations, and an evidenceâ€‘based taper so you arrive fresh.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety first:</strong> Conservative defaults, medicalâ€‘clearance awareness, and swaps for weather/routes help you keep momentum without overreaching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why these plans are scienceâ€‘based (pillars)</h2>
<p>We combined <strong>military loadâ€‘carriage literature</strong>, <strong>exercise physiology</strong>, and <strong>falls prevention</strong> research with coaching best practices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zone 2 foundation:</strong> Builds mitochondrial capacity and fat oxidation while keeping stress manageable.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixedâ€‘load tempo and short intervals:</strong> Improve speed economy and VOâ‚‚ without compounding stress from load bumps the same week.</li>
  <li><strong>One variable per week:</strong> Time <em>or</em> elevation <em>or</em> load. Weekly increase cap â‰ˆ10% to reduce overuse risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Deloads every ~4 weeks:</strong> Volume reductions support adaptation and lower injury risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength + carries:</strong> Antiâ€‘lateral core and lowerâ€‘body strength improve gait under load and resilience on hills.</li>
  <li><strong>Fuel/hydration guidelines:</strong> ACSMâ€‘aligned carbohydrate and sodium ranges for long efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plan overview and the science behind each</h2>

<h3>1) Posture/Balance &amp; Age Strong (8 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Anyone prioritizing posture, balance, and jointâ€‘friendly consistency. Uses a <strong>vest (6â€“12% BW)</strong> bias for even distribution and calm breathing mechanics. Mobility is daily (10â€“15 min). Strength &amp; balance twice weekly (sitâ€‘toâ€‘stand, stepâ€‘ups, suitcase carries, side planks). <strong>Deload in week 4</strong> (âˆ’20â€“30% ruck minutes and one set).</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> Postâ€‘menopausal and older adults maintain bone and function best with <strong>consistent, progressive mechanical loading</strong> plus balance work. Longâ€‘term weighted programs have shown maintenance of <strong>hip BMD</strong><sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>, highâ€‘intensity resistance/impact training improves bone outcomes and function<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>, and structured balance work reduces fall risk<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Progressions:</strong> Side plank +10â€“15 s/week, carries +5â€“10 m/week; <strong>load +1% BW every ~4 weeks</strong> only if joints feel normal.</li>
  <li><strong>Retests:</strong> Balance biâ€‘weekly; weekâ€‘8 functional checks (plank total, singleâ€‘leg balance, 10â€‘rep sitâ€‘toâ€‘stand).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Get Faster at Rucking (8 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Athletes targeting pace gains. Weekly mix: <strong>Z2 duration</strong>, <strong>tempo with fixed load</strong>, <strong>intervals 6â€“10Ã—2:00/2:00</strong>, plus 1Ã— strength and 1Ã— unloaded cardio. <strong>72 h</strong> between hard sessions is common; <strong>deload in week 4</strong> (~âˆ’30% time/vert). Load stays fixed on tempo/interval days until Week â‰¥3.</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> A <strong>polarized/thresholdâ€‘aware</strong> balanceâ€”mostly Z2 with select quality workâ€”improves aerobic economy and durability<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Keeping load fixed during tempo/intervals prevents compounding stress, while intervals sharpen speed and technique with controlled mechanics.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Progressions:</strong> Weekly increase cap â‰¤10% total volume. No load bumps on hard weeks and deloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Retests:</strong> Weekâ€‘8 60â€‘minute ruck at baseline load/route; optional 5k run time to track economy transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Event Prep: 12â€‘mile under 3:00 (or custom, 12 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Timeâ€‘oriented goals with a set load (often <strong>14â€“20 kg / 30â€“45 lb</strong>). Mix of <strong>intervals</strong>, <strong>tempo (fixed load)</strong>, <strong>long ruck to 150â€“165 min</strong>, and one easy run/bike. <strong>Taper 7â€“10 days</strong> (âˆ’40â€“50% volume) while maintaining intensity. Practice fueling on long days every 30â€“40 min.</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> Specificity with adequate recovery. Fixedâ€‘load quality sessions keep movement patterns crisp. Long rucks build substrate use and softâ€‘tissue tolerance<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The taper literature supports reducing volume while preserving intensity for best raceâ€‘day performance<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Progressions:</strong> Vert +100â€“150 m/week (tempo or long) only when recovery is green; <strong>only the Long day</strong> may add +2 kg every 2â€“3 weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Milestones:</strong> 10â€‘mile simulation ~2 weeks out; no new load PRs during taper.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Fat Loss &amp; Feel Better (12 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Sustainable fat loss with performance maintenance. Three Z2 rucks (start 120â€“150 min/week â†’ 170â€“200 min), 2Ã— strength, and 2Ã— unloaded cardio. <strong>Z2 target:</strong> 40â€“59% HRR (~60â€“70% HRmax). Use <strong>HR decoupling â‰¤10%</strong> to verify true aerobic work. Deload every 4th week (~âˆ’30% ruck minutes).</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> Z2 prioritizes fat oxidation and mitochondrial adaptations while controlling stress<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Preserving lean mass requires 2Ã—/week strength. Nutrition guidelines (carbs and sodium) during long rucks mitigate drift and support quality<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Progressions:</strong> +5â€“10 min to one ruck <em>or</em> +50â€“100 m vert <em>or</em> +1â€“2% BW every 2â€“3 weeks if recovery is greenâ€”<em>never two at once</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Retests:</strong> Body mass and resting HR weekly; 30â€‘minute ruck TT at weeks 0/6/12 at baseline load/route.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) Load Capacity Builder (8 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Building carrying capacity safely with timeâ€‘capped schedules. <strong>Only the long day</strong> progresses load (+1â€“2% BW every 2â€“3 weeks if green). Other rucks hold load and focus on technique and Z2. Strength 
focuses on hinges, singleâ€‘leg work, and carries. Deload in week 4 (~âˆ’30% time; keep load).</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> Tissue tolerance improves with <strong>time under steady load</strong> and conservative progression. Separating load progression to one day limits cumulative mechanical stress. Suitcase carries and stepâ€‘ups improve antiâ€‘lateral strength and uphill mechanics. Military loadâ€‘carriage literature details how load magnitude and distribution influence physiology and injury risk<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>6) Daily Discipline Streak (4 weeks)</h3>
<p><em>Who itâ€™s for:</em> Habit formation and recovery. Minimum viable sessions count (10â€“15 min unloaded). Z2 anchors the week, with optional light vest recovery walks (5â€“10% BW). Intensity cap at RPE â‰¤3.</p>
<p><em>Why it works:</em> Daily lowâ€‘intensity movement improves compliance and tissue health while avoiding overuse. Habit psychology favors <em>small wins repeated</em> over occasional heroic efforts.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Are these plans personalized?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Each plan exposes knobs for equipment, time budget, intensity, safe starting load, terrain, scheduled days, and route/weather swaps. Event Prep includes event date/distance/load and autoâ€‘tapers.</p>

<h3>Why fixed load on tempo/intervals?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To <em>separate stressors</em>. Quality work improves economy and technique; load bumps add mechanical stress. Combining both in the same week raises injury risk and blunts adaptation.</p>

<h3>What does â‰¤10% HR decoupling mean?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> On steady Z2 efforts, if heart rate drifts &gt;~10% relative to pace/power, youâ€™re likely pushing too hard or underâ€‘fueledâ€”repeat the week and/or adjust fueling.</p>

<h3>How were fueling and sodium targets chosen?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We follow ACSM consensus and endurance literature: <strong>30â€“60 g carbs</strong>/hour (up to 90 g with gut training) and <strong>~0.5â€“0.7 g sodium</strong>/L for long or hot sessions. Individual needs varyâ€”practice in training.</p>

<h3>Why vests for postureâ€‘friendly loading?</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Even distribution and reduced bounce can make breathing easier at light loads for some users, particularly in the Age Strong plan. Backpacks are preferred when loads rise or for speedâ€‘specific core work.</p>
