<h2>Do Weighted Vests Help Bone Density?</h2>
<p>Short answer: there’s promising evidence in older adults and during weight loss that vests help maintain—or sometimes improve—BMD. For younger, healthy folks, it’s a smart long-game habit alongside protein and strength training.</p>

<h3>What the studies say</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Long-term hip preservation</strong>: Women using weighted vests in an exercise program prevented expected hip bone loss over a year.</li>
  <li><strong>During weight loss</strong>: Daily vest use in older adults undergoing diet-induced weight loss helped preserve hip/spine BMD vs controls.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparisons</strong>: Resistance training remains powerful; vest + walk is a practical additive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practical protocol</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2–4 sessions/week of vest walking; start at 5–10% BW.</li>
  <li>Layer in 2–3 strength sessions (squats/hinges/steps/pushes/pulls).</li>
  <li>Protein 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day; vitamin D and calcium per guidelines.</li>
</ul>
