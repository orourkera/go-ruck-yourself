    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: May 1, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Go Ruck Yourself</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and website.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We collect information you provide directly, such as your email address, weight, and preferences when you register or update your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymized data about your app usage (e.g., ruck sessions, feature usage) to improve the app experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device information such as model, OS version, and crash logs for diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Health & Heart Rate Data (if enabled):</strong> If you enable Health integration, we collect heart rate samples during rucking sessions for real-time feedback, calorie estimation, and post-session analytics (average, max, min heart rate). Heart rate data is stored locally on your device, never sold or used for advertising, and is not shared with third parties unless you enable cloud sync or backup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the app’s core features.</li>
      <li>To personalize your experience and improve our services.</li>
      <li>To display heart rate analytics and provide feedback during sessions (if enabled).</li>
      <li>To communicate important updates, offers, or support.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect user safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do <b>not</b> sell your personal information. We share data in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We share data with trusted third parties necessary for app functionality (e.g., analytics, payment processing) and only as required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Ruck Buddies Feature:</strong> Our app includes a social feature called "Ruck Buddies" that allows users to view ruck sessions completed by other users. By default, your completed ruck sessions will be visible to other users in the Ruck Buddies feed, including your username and session details (distance, duration, calories burned, elevation gain, and an approximate route map). Your exact start/end locations are not shared for privacy reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can update or delete your account information at any time within the app.</li>
      <li>You may opt out of heart rate data collection by disabling Health integration in the app settings. Disabling heart rate will revert calorie estimation to a standard MET-based calculation.</li>
      <li><strong>Ruck Sharing Privacy:</strong> You can control whether your ruck sessions appear in the Ruck Buddies feed by toggling the "Allow Ruck Sharing" option in your profile settings. Additionally, you can choose to make individual ruck sessions private even if sharing is enabled globally.</li>
      <li>Contact us at <a href="mailto:rory@getrucky.com">rory@getrucky.com</a> to request data deletion or with any privacy questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes within the app or by email.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, contact <a href="mailto:rory@getrucky.com">rory@getrucky.com</a>.</p>
