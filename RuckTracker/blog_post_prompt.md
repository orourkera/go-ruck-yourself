3. **Read comment threads** for detailed user experiences and follow-up questions

↓
Authoritative Data: "Studies show 65% injury rate when exceeding 20% body weight initially"
↓

↓
Practical Application: "Start with 10-15% body weight as both Reddit veterans and experts recommend"
```

#### How to Quote Influencers Effectively:
- **Use specific principles**: "Peter Attia's research on Zone 2 cardio shows that rucking at 60-70% max heart rate..."
- **Reference their expertise**: "Gary Brecka, a human biohacking expert, emphasizes that..."
- **Connect to rucking**: Don't force connections - only use when genuinely relevant
- **Maintain credibility**: Only quote verified statements, not casual social media posts
- **Balance voices**: Don't over-rely on any single influencer

#### Influencer Content Search Strategy:
1. **YouTube/Podcast searches**: "Andrew Huberman load carriage", "Peter Attia zone 2 cardio"
2. **Website/blog content**: Look for detailed articles on relevant topics
3. **Scientific papers they reference**: Use their citations as research starting points
4. **Social media posts**: Only for general principles, not specific claims
5. **Book content**: Reference published works for authoritative quotes

### SEO Technical Requirements:
- **Target blog post length**: 1,500-2,500 words
- **Primary keyword density**: 1-2% (natural placement)
- **Include related keywords** throughout content
- **Meta description**: 150-160 characters with primary keyword
- **At least 3 internal links** to GetRucky.com pages

### Voice Examples:
✅ **Good**: "Rucking torches calories like a bonfire burns marshmallows – efficiently and with satisfying results. Studies show you'll burn 2-3x more calories than regular walking, which means you can actually see your Netflix time paying dividends."

❌ **Avoid**: "Rucking is a superior form of cardiovascular exercise that provides enhanced caloric expenditure compared to traditional ambulatory activities."
