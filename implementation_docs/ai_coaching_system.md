# AI Coaching System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive AI coaching system for the Ruck! app, designed to provide personalized, adaptive coaching that goes beyond simple plan execution to create a true coaching relationship with users.

## Core Philosophy
Think **Netflix recommendations, not gym class curriculum**. The AI should learn user preferences, adapt to their reality, and create a personalized coaching experience that becomes more valuable over time.

## Conclusion

This AI coaching system transforms the Ruck! app from a session tracker into a comprehensive fitness coach that understands, adapts, and grows with each user. The key is creating a system that feels personal, intelligent, and genuinely helpful - not just a sophisticated to-do list.

The implementation should focus on building the foundational elements first, then gradually adding intelligence and personalization features that make the coaching experience more valuable over time.
