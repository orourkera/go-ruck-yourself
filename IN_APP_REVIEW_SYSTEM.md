# üåü Ruck! In-App Review System

This document explains the intelligent in-app review system implemented in the Ruck! app, designed to maximize positive reviews while filtering negative feedback to support channels.

## üéØ Overview

The in-app review system follows industry best practices to:
- ‚úÖ **Intercept negative feedback** and direct it to support instead of App Store
- ‚úÖ **Only prompt engaged users** after meaningful achievements (1km+ rucks)
- ‚úÖ **Use native review dialogs** (SKStoreReviewController on iOS, ReviewManager on Android)
- ‚úÖ **Respect platform guidelines** (max 3 prompts per year, proper timing)
- ‚úÖ **Provide analytics** for data-driven optimization

## üìã Implementation Details

### Trigger Conditions

The system only prompts for reviews when ALL conditions are met:

1. **Qualifying Activity**: Completed a ruck of 1km+ distance
2. **User Engagement**: First 1km+ ruck, or 5th ruck, or 15th ruck
3. **Timing Constraints**: At least 90 days since last review request
4. **Request Limits**: Maximum 3 requests per year (Apple/Google guidelines)
5. **No Prior Review**: User hasn't already left a review

### Two-Step Process

#### Step 1: Satisfaction Check
```
üéí How are you enjoying Ruck!?

Your feedback helps us make Ruck! even better for the rucking community.

[Could be better] [I love it!]
```

#### Step 2A: Positive Response ‚Üí App Store Review
```
üåü That's awesome!

Would you mind taking a moment to rate Ruck! on the App Store? 
It really helps other ruckers discover our app.

[Maybe later] [Sure, let's do it!] ‚≠ê
```

#### Step 2B: Negative Response ‚Üí Support Feedback
```
üí° Help us improve!

We'd love to hear how we can make Ruck! better for you. 
Would you like to send us your feedback directly?

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Service: `InAppReviewService`

Located: `/lib/core/services/in_app_review_service.dart`

**Key Methods:**
- `checkAndPromptAfterRuck()` - Main entry point, checks conditions and prompts
- `getReviewStatus()` - Returns current tracking data for analytics
- `debugForceShowReviewDialog()` - Testing helper (debug builds only)
- `debugResetReviewTracking()` - Reset tracking for testing

### Integration Point

**File**: `/lib/features/ruck_session/presentation/screens/session_complete_screen.dart`

**Integration**: Called in `_saveAndContinue()` method after successful session completion:

```dart
// üåü Check for in-app review prompt after successful session completion
if (mounted) {
  await _inAppReviewService.checkAndPromptAfterRuck(
    distanceKm: widget.distance, // widget.distance is already in km
    context: context,
  );
}
```

### Data Tracking

Uses `SharedPreferences` to track:
- `review_request_count` - Number of times review was requested
- `last_review_request_date` - ISO timestamp of last request
- `has_left_review` - Boolean flag if user completed review flow
- `completed_rucks_count` - Total rucks completed (for engagement tracking)

## üß™ Testing & Debug

### Debug Screen Integration

Access via Feature Flags Debug Screen:
1. Navigate to debug screen (development builds)
2. Tap **"Test In-App Review"** button
3. View console logs for detailed flow information

### Manual Testing

```dart
// Force show review dialog (debug builds only)
final reviewService = InAppReviewService();
await reviewService.debugForceShowReviewDialog(context);

// Reset tracking data
await reviewService.debugResetReviewTracking();

// Get current status
final status = await reviewService.getReviewStatus();
print('Review Status: $status');
```

### Console Logs

Look for logs prefixed with `[InAppReview]`:
- `[InAppReview] Native review dialog shown`
- `[InAppReview] Reset review tracking`
- `[InAppReview] Error requesting review: ...`

## üìä Analytics & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Review Prompt Show Rate**: How often conditions are met
2. **Positive vs Negative Response Rate**: Balance of satisfaction
3. **App Store Review Completion Rate**: Final review submissions
4. **Support Feedback Volume**: Negative feedback redirected

### Data-Driven Optimization

The system is designed to be tunable based on analytics:

```dart
// Current thresholds (can be adjusted)
static const double _qualifyingRuckDistanceKm = 1.0;
static const int _minDaysBetweenRequests = 90;
static const int _maxReviewRequestsPerYear = 3;

// Engagement triggers (can be modified)
if (completedRucks == 1) { // First 1km+ ruck
if (completedRucks == 5 && requestCount == 0) { // 5th ruck, first ask
if (completedRucks == 15 && requestCount == 1) { // 15th ruck, second ask
```

### Recommended Adjustments

Based on your analytics, consider adjusting:

- **Distance threshold**: Lower to 0.5km if 1km is too restrictive
- **Timing intervals**: Reduce from 90 days if users are highly engaged
- **Engagement triggers**: Add more trigger points for power users

## üîß Configuration

### App Store Configuration

**App Store ID**: `6504239036` (Ruck! App Store ID)
**Support Email**: `support@getrucky.com`

### Platform Behavior

**iOS**: Uses `SKStoreReviewController.requestReview()`
- Native system dialog
- Automatically follows Apple's guidelines
- May not show if user has been prompted recently

**Android**: Uses `ReviewManager.launchReviewFlow()`
- In-app review dialog
- Follows Google Play guidelines
- More predictable display behavior

## üö® Important Notes

### Apple Guidelines Compliance

- ‚úÖ Maximum 3 prompts per 365-day period
- ‚úÖ Only shown after positive user interactions
- ‚úÖ Uses native `SKStoreReviewController`
- ‚úÖ No custom buttons or "Rate Now" prompts
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling when review isn't available

### Google Play Guidelines Compliance

- ‚úÖ Uses official `ReviewManager` API
- ‚úÖ Doesn't interfere with organic reviews
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for review flow
- ‚úÖ No forced review requests

### Best Practices Followed

1. **Timing**: Only after successful, meaningful user actions
2. **Frequency**: Respectful limits prevent user annoyance
3. **Value Exchange**: Clear benefit explanation for users
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for all error scenarios
5. **Privacy**: No personal data collection, all tracking local

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Positive Impact
- **Higher Review Rates**: Engaged users more likely to review positively
- **Better App Store Rating**: Negative feedback filtered to support
- **Improved User Experience**: Respectful, non-intrusive prompting
- **Actionable Feedback**: Direct developer feedback for improvements

### Success Metrics
- Increase in App Store rating from current baseline
- Reduction in negative public reviews
- Increase in support feedback volume (positive indicator)
- Higher user satisfaction scores

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **A/B Testing**: Test different messaging and timing strategies
2. **Localization**: Translate prompts for international users
3. **Personalization**: Customize messaging based on user behavior
4. **Analytics Integration**: Connect to Firebase Analytics for deeper insights
5. **Machine Learning**: Predict optimal timing for each user

### Advanced Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user text input to better route feedback
2. **Progressive Prompting**: Start with simple thumbs up/down before full review
3. **Contextual Timing**: Prompt after specific achievements or milestones
4. **Social Proof**: Show community stats to encourage participation
