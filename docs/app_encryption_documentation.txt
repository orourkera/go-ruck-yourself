App Encryption Documentation - Rucking App
==============================================

ENCRYPTION USAGE SUMMARY
------------------------
Answer to Apple's Questions: NO to both

The Rucking app uses only standard encryption algorithms provided by Apple's iOS 
operating system and widely-accepted industry standards. No proprietary or 
non-standard encryption is implemented.


DETAILED ENCRYPTION USAGE
--------------------------

1. Network Communications
   - HTTPS/TLS 1.2+: All API communications with backend services
   - Firebase SDK: Standard Google Firebase encryption for push notifications 
     and analytics
   - Standard: Uses OS-provided encryption, no custom implementation

2. Local Data Storage
   - Flutter Secure Storage: Utilizes iOS Keychain for secure token storage
   - SQLite: Standard database storage without additional encryption layers
   - Standard: Relies entirely on iOS-provided security mechanisms

3. Authentication & Tokens
   - OAuth 2.0/JWT: Standard authentication token handling
   - API Keys: Stored using iOS Keychain via Flutter Secure Storage
   - Standard: Industry-standard authentication protocols only

4. Payment Processing (if applicable)
   - RevenueCat/App Store: Uses Apple's standard payment encryption
   - Standard: No custom payment encryption implementation

5. Health & Location Data
   - HealthKit Integration: Uses Apple's standard HealthKit encryption
   - Core Location: Standard iOS location services encryption
   - Standard: Entirely dependent on Apple's OS-level encryption


CERTIFICATION STATEMENT
------------------------

The Rucking app:
✓ Uses ONLY standard encryption algorithms accepted by international bodies 
  (IEEE, IETF, ITU)
✓ Does NOT implement any proprietary encryption algorithms
✓ Relies EXCLUSIVELY on encryption provided by Apple's iOS operating system
✓ Does NOT access or modify the OS encryption implementation
✓ Uses standard HTTPS/TLS for all network communications
✓ Uses standard iOS Keychain for secure storage via Flutter Secure Storage

Therefore:
- Question 1: NO - Does not use proprietary encryption
- Question 2: NO - Does not use encryption beyond what's provided by iOS

This app is EXEMPT from export control requirements under Category 5 Part 2 
as it uses only standard, publicly available encryption.
