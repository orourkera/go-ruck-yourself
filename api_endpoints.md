# RuckingApp API Endpoints Reference

> **IMPORTANT URL CONSTRUCTION NOTE**:
> The base URL is configured as `https://getrucky.com/api` (without a trailing slash).
> When making API requests, **always include a leading slash** in your endpoint paths.
> Example: Use `/rucks/{id}/heart_rate` instead of `rucks/{id}/heart_rate`
> This ensures the URL is properly constructed as `https://getrucky.com/api/rucks/{id}/heart_rate`
> rather than the incorrect `https://getrucky.com/apirucks/{id}/heart_rate`
